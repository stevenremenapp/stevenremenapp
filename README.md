### Hello, I'm Steve 👋

💻 I'm a developer that likes JavaScript (particularly Vue) and loves CSS/Sass. I specialize in frontend development, and am also working on learning NodeJS, databases, and software architecture more deeply. I love making software that solves problems for people and/or delights them.  
📚 In a past life I was a librarian. I still care deeply about libraries and have made some web projects that librarians currently use.
